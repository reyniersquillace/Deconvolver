Welcome to my collection of neural network methods for the decomposition of complex pulse profiles! There are a variety of trained models here suitable for different applications. The models themselves are stored in the `pickle_jar`, where the `.pkl` files live along with the relevant loss curves. Along with the models, this repo contains code for training the models yourself. Why would you want to do this, since I'm brilliant and my best model has a stunningly high accuracy rate of [some very low percentage probably]? Searchc me, but you can!
